    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> December 2025</p>

    <p>
      Stylit (“Stylit”, “we”, “us”) provides an AI-powered fashion app that helps users try on outfits,
      ask for feedback through pods, and explore styles.
      This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use Stylit.
    </p>

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>

    <h3>1) Account information</h3>
    <p>
      If you create an account, we may collect identifiers such as email or an account ID and basic profile settings
      (for example: display preferences).
    </p>

    <h3>2) Photos and content you provide</h3>
    <p>
      You may upload photos (for example, a selfie) and images of garments or product links/screenshots for try-on,
      analysis, and pod posts. These are processed to provide features like AI try-on and AI insights.
    </p>

    <h3>3) App activity</h3>
    <p>
      We collect usage data such as feature interactions (e.g., which products you view, votes you cast, pods you create),
      and technical logs needed to keep the app working reliably.
    </p>

    <h3>4) Device/technical data</h3>
    <p>
      We may collect device and diagnostic information (such as app version, timestamps, and error logs)
      to troubleshoot issues and improve performance.
    </p>

    <h2>How we use your information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and operate the Stylit app (try-on, pods, explore, and insights features).</li>
      <li>Process images to generate AI try-on results and AI recommendations/insights.</li>
      <li>Maintain safety, prevent abuse, and enforce policies.</li>
      <li>Improve product experience, reliability, and features.</li>
      <li>Communicate with you for support and important service updates.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How we share your information</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your personal information. We share information only as needed to operate Stylit:
    </p>

    <h3>Service providers (processors)</h3>
    <p>Stylit uses third-party providers to host data and run AI features. These may process data on our behalf:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Supabase</strong> — authentication, database, and storage for user content (e.g., uploaded images).</li>
      <li><strong>Vercel</strong> — hosting for backend/API endpoints and web pages.</li>
      <li><strong>Replicate</strong> — AI model execution for virtual try-on (images are sent to generate results).</li>
      <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> — AI analysis/insights features (text and/or derived descriptions may be processed).</li>
      <li><strong>Google Gemini</strong> — AI analysis/insights features (text and/or derived descriptions may be processed).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These providers are used strictly to deliver Stylit functionality. We aim to minimize data shared and
      restrict it to what is necessary for the requested feature.
    </p>

    <h2>Public vs private content</h2>
    <p>
      Some features let you share content (for example, posts to Explore pods). If you choose to post publicly
      or to a broader group, other users may be able to view and vote on that content.
      If you keep content private (e.g., Friends-only), it is intended to be visible only within that scope.
    </p>

    <h2>Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      We keep information as long as needed to provide the service or comply with legal obligations.
      You may request deletion of your account and associated content by contacting support (below).
    </p>

    <h2>Your choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can choose what you upload and what you share publicly vs privately.</li>
      <li>You can update or remove certain profile details inside the app.</li>
      <li>You can request account deletion by contacting support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children’s privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Stylit is not intended for children under 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information,
      contact us and we will take appropriate steps.
    </p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable administrative and technical safeguards to protect information.
      No system is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>International users</h2>
    <p>
      Stylit may process data in countries other than your own, depending on where our service providers operate.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the “Effective date” above when changes are made.
    </p>
