      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <p class="muted">Effective date: December 22, 2025</p>
      <p class="muted">
        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of Stylit (the “App”) and our website.
        By using Stylit, you agree to these Terms.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>1) Who we are</h2>
      <p>
        “Stylit,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Stylit. “You” refers to the person using the App.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>2) Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 13 years old to use Stylit. If you are under the age of majority in your region,
        you must have permission from a parent or legal guardian.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>3) Your account</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You are responsible for keeping your account secure.</li>
        <li>You agree not to impersonate others or use false information in a misleading way.</li>
        <li>We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>4) Photos, uploads, and content rules</h2>
      <p>
        Stylit allows you to upload images (for example, a body photo for AI try-on and a face photo for color analysis).
        You keep ownership of your content. You grant us a limited license to process your content to provide the app features.
      </p>

      <h3>Content you must not upload</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nudity</strong> or explicit sexual content.</li>
        <li>Images of <strong>minors</strong> that are sexualized or inappropriate.</li>
        <li>Harassment, hate, violence, illegal content, or content that infringes others’ rights.</li>
        <li>Anything that you do not have the legal right to upload.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Quality notice</h3>
      <p>
        AI try-on and color suggestions depend on photo quality. Blurry, cropped, very dark images, or very loose clothing
        may reduce accuracy.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>5) AI features and disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        Stylit provides AI-generated suggestions (fit insights, size guidance, color season suggestions, style feedback).
        These outputs are informational only and may be inaccurate. Stylit is not a substitute for professional advice.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>We do not guarantee fit, sizing accuracy, or purchase outcomes.</li>
        <li>We do not guarantee that AI outputs will be error-free or always available.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>6) Pods, voting, and community behavior</h2>
      <p>
        Stylit includes features like “Pods” (asking friends or the community for feedback). You agree to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Be respectful and avoid harassment or hate.</li>
        <li>Not spam, manipulate votes, or abuse invitations.</li>
        <li>Not upload content that violates our rules or others’ privacy.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We may remove content or restrict access if we believe it harms users or violates these Terms.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>7) Shopping links and third-party services</h2>
      <p>

        websites and are governed by their terms and policies.
      </p>

    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>8) Third-party providers we use</h2>
      <p>
        Stylit may use third-party infrastructure and AI services to operate features (for example: Supabase, Replicate,
        OpenAI, Google Gemini, and hosting providers like Vercel). Their services may process data as needed to provide
        functionality. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details.

    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>9) Termination</h2>

        by law, safety, or security reasons.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>10) Limitation of liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, Stylit is not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
        punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, or goodwill. Your use of the App is at your own risk.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card">
      <h2>11) Changes to these Terms</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will update the effective date above.
        Continued use of Stylit after changes means you accept the updated Terms.
